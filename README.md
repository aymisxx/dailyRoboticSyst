# dailyRoboticSyst ⚙️

This repository is my **daily robotics systems learning log**.

The goal is simple:
- show up **every day**.
- learn at least **one concept**.
- produce **one honest artifact**.
- make **one GitHub commit**.

## Why this repo exists

This repo exists to:
- build intuition step by step.
- connect theory to implementation.
- avoid tutorial-hopping.
- document failures as much as successes.
- prove consistency over time.

## How this repo is organized

Each folder corresponds to **one day**.

```
dayXX/
├── README.md        # what I tried, what I learned, what broke
├── demo.py          # minimal runnable code or simulation (optional)
└── notebook.ipynb   # main learning artifact with explanations + code
```

Not every day will contain every file.  
Some days are math-heavy. Some are code-heavy. Some are conceptual.

## Learning scope

Over time, this repo touches:

- Control systems (PID, LQR, MPC intuition).
- State estimation (Kalman filter, EKF basics).
- Physical modeling and dynamics.
- Sensors and noise.
- Perception fundamentals.
- Planning and trajectory generation.
- Simulation environments.
- ROS2 and distributed robotics concepts.
- Real-world constraints and safety thinking.

Depth increases naturally. There is no fixed syllabus.

## Notebook policy

Notebooks are a **first-class learning artifact** in this repo.

Each daily notebook:
- contains **clear markdown explanations** of the concept.
- includes **clean, readable code cells**.
- documents assumptions, observations, and results.
- prioritizes understanding over optimization.

When useful, supporting `.py` files may be added for reuse or clarity,  
but the notebook remains the primary place where learning is expressed.

Notebooks are expected to be:
- readable top-to-bottom.
- concept-driven, not cell-order hacks.
- presentable to a technically literate reader.

## Rules I follow

- One small concept per day (at least).
- One commit per day (no zero days), starting from 1st January, 2026.
- No copy-paste learning.
- If something fails, document *why*.
- Clarity > cleverness.
- Consistency > intensity.

This is **learning in public**, done honestly.

## End goal

By the end of this arc, this repo should reflect:
- systems thinking
- control-first intuition
- comfort with uncertainty and failure
- the habit of building, not just reading
